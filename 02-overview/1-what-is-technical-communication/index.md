## What is technical communication?

### Does exactly what it says on the tin

Especially if the tin features meal prep instructions!  

[ITCQF](https://itcqf.org/) describes technical communication as a field that  

> [...] *combines a range of disciplines that work together to efficiently transfer specialized information to those who need it to accomplish a defined task or goal.[^1]*

A translator needn't be tutored on *the functions of language* and on how information is transferred. In short: it doesn't have to be written; and yet, people, by default, make assumptions based on [*that which is seen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window), and not *that which isn't.* Hence, even though tech comm professionals communicate *a lot* outside of writing, their job is associated mostly with **documentation** (and other content creation).  

Documentation, that is *documents*, as in: instruction manuals, guidelines, specifications, training materials, and many–a–similar other.  

Ideally, documentation should exist within the following information lifecycle[^2], separately from the product itself:  

![Information lifecycle](../../images/information-lifecycle.png)  

This representation, with a presumably infinite cycle, makes much sense in the context of information, which is naturally subject to constant changes: to being abandoned, and then retrieved; to recycling, and to redefining; to becoming outdated, revised – and then reupdated.  

As already mentioned, these changes occur separately from changes in the product; and at that they are more volatile. A small but sudden change in the product won't throw the development team off guard, but it will have a huge impact on the documentation project. The product's goal is achieved anyway: to deliver a working solution. The documentation project, however, is shaken, since its goal is to deliver up-to-date content that describes current state of the product, in a manner comprehensive and complete.  

Technical communicators should thus be flexible and prepared to adapt to changes; more so than to strictly follow procedures and tasks as specified in project development stages –  

but the stages are no less important.  

### Projects of many stages

Every project begins with **planning:** to draw up a list of steps/tasks in the project; to estimate time, cost, and effort required for each of them, and to identify potential risks.  

Then it moves onto **research and design**, where requirements are specified, tools and publishing routes selected, and where the target audience, the type, and the scope of documents, as well as risks and constraints are identified. What follows from this analysis are adequate design choices: to create documentation for this or that type of audience, via this or that publishing route, in this or that many formats and copies, with these or those tools, and with content of this or that scope; with a specific level of technicality, number of visual elements, and so on.  

Then, documentation is **developed**, **reviewed** (or [tested](../../04-learning-the-basics/3-content-design/index.md/#testing)), and finally **published** – but technical communicators' role doesn't end there.  

Documentation must be **maintained**, to account for the aforementioned changes, which – especially in the case of software and [agile](../../09-glossary/index.md/#a) development – happen often and way past the initial product release. Even physical products require constant customer support and quality control – which are supplemented by documents as well.  

When documentation is no longer up to date nor relevant due to major changes in the product (or due to its discontinuation), the cycle is repeated: there are always new versions, new products, and new projects ahead.  

To paraphrase [Benjamin Franklin](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/benjamin-franklins-last-great-quote-and-the-constitution):  

> ❝*[...] in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes*❞

> – and documents.  

### What disciplines are there in tech comm?

Apart from technical writing, which is creating documentation, there are a few other, related disciplines within technical communication. 

* **Technical editing** consists in proofreading and editing documentation to ensure linguistic, as well as technical correctness, and to evaluate documents based on how well they fit specified criteria and meet objectives of the project.  

* **Graphic design** in tech comm involves various tasks concerning visual media: creating and editing website styling, images, diagrams, infographics, etc.  

* **Information architecture** is the structural design of documentation; it focuses on organizing the content in such a way as to facilitate users' interaction with the documents and ensure efficient communication.  

* **User experience (UX)** is less about structural organization of information and more about intuitive design; it concerns the stylistic and functional elements of documentation's design that influence user's experience: the intuitiveness of the interface, simplicity of use, and *usability* of documentation, i.e., the degree to which users' interaction with the document effectively serves their purpose.  

* **Technical training** involves planning and creating educational materials, organizing and carrying out training sessions, and similar; in principle: on technical topics.  

* **Technical translation** will surely be your forte if you happen to deal with it in the new field – which you might. Translation-related tasks may involve preparing documents for localization or discussing the design of the document with the translators during planning and design phases, so that later performed localization will be seamless. Imagine, for example, possible layout issues when translating documents to languages with right-to-left writing systems, or with ideographs and syllabaries instead of regular alphabets.  

### Technical writer – how important?

Technical writers are as important as the content they create – and good documentation is invaluable. Of course, some would disagree. After all, products work fine without useless manuals that nobody reads. I'll do you one better: products work fine without marketing, quality assurance, customer support...  

Business is not about selling products that *just* work, nor is technology about strapping sticks together and calling it toolmaking. Respectable companies know that, and they realize how much value technical writers bring to an organization.  

First of all, technical writers aid end users. In so doing, they relieve customer service and reduce costs of product support. They also help users avoid risks, with instructions that follow safety standards.  

Secondly, they help with marketing. Some of the content tech writers produce can be used in advertising or as a demo to give customers an idea of what the product does. Well-written documents indicate good organization too, which may be an incentive for investors.  

Finally, technical writers participate in product development. They are often the first beta-testers; they can make useful comments or report bugs. They prepare training materials, they document processes, and they archive data for future reference. They help standardize procedures and make their colleague's work more efficient.

Documentation is a lot like translation: people usually notice it when it's terrible or when it's not there at all. Professionals work half their life on a craft in which an average Joe claims proficiency after taking two courses and watching a season of *Friends* without subtitles. Over the years, said professionals develop skills most haven't heard of, and eventually they get paid good money: either by someone desperate for help, someone who knows pros will do it better, or someone who doesn't have the time to do it any more.  

Sounds familiar, only that this time there's technology. There's coding. There's graphic design. There are passionate people who know that *[innovation happens at intersections](https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling/)*. You might be in for a treat!
