## Certificates

### ITCQF

[ITCQF](https://itcqf.org/), or International Technical Communication Qualifications Foundation (yes, just stick with the abbreviation), is an organization founded in Kraków, in 2014, by a number of tech comm speciaists. Their mission is to:  

> *[...] promote the value of technical communication [...], help technical communicators to be more efficient [...], and to continually advance our knowledge base by incorporating the best industry practices and the most innovative research [...]*  
> — *[ITCQF](https://itcqf.org/about/)*  

and they are doing great at that! Some of the names behind ITCQF include people from [Techwriter.pl](http://techwriter.pl/) and initiators of the first tech comm [university program](../5-degrees/index.md/#technical-communication-at-university) in Poland. With more people interested in content every year, and technical writers' salaries showing a [growing trend](http://techwriter.pl/wyniki-badania-plac-w-komunikacji-technicznej-2021/) – their efforts seem to pay off.  

ITCQF offers an accredited course: Certificate for Technical Communication Professionals – Foundation Level. The two-day program prepares you to take a certified exam.  

The knowledge is pretty rudimentary, but it's the milestone you need to pass to get further in an orderly manner. You will learn about the documentation lifecycle, types of deliverables, and different phases of a documentation project, among other things. For details, check the [syllabus](https://itcqf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ITCQF_Syllabus_v2_0Jun2020.pdf).  

The true value of the course lies in the opportunity to meet people from the field; to ask questions and get insight; to hear anecdotes and real-life examples. This is something you won't read about in textbooks.  

In Poland, there are currently two course providers that offer ITCQF training and assist you with the exam:  

* [Dredar](https://dredar.com/services/training/itcqf-foundation)
* [ITtraining](http://edu.ittraining.pl/szkolenie/ITCQF_Poziom_Podstawowy)

The exams are carried out by [GASQ](https://www.gasq.org/en/certification/itcqf.html) – Global Association for Software Quality. It is a reputable, accredited center, so rest assured: the exam will be trouble-free and light on paperwork. You may wait a while for your certificate, but other than that I can recommend GASQ.  

Keep an eye out for new courses from ITCQF. The organization is fairly young, as is the technical writing scene in Poland. The field is blooming, though, and the demand for specialists is rising. It is only natural that new courses and certificates should pop up any time soon!  

### Tools- and skill-specific courses

Apart from ITCQF, there are other certified courses for skill- and tool-specific purposes. Examples include:

* [Certified STE Masterclass](https://www.shufrans-techdocs.com/event/europe-online-certified-ste-masterclass/)  
* [MadCap Flare Intermediate Training Course](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/services/paid-training/flare-intermediate-training/#content)
* [Practical Introduction to Digital Accessibility](https://dredar.com/services/trainings-and-workshops/practical-introduction-to-digital-accessibility)
* [Python for Testers and Technical Writers](https://dredar.com/services/trainings-and-workshops/python-for-testers-and-technical-writers)

Still, as a beginner, you'll be best served by ITCQF. Once you enter the field and your career takes its course, you'll know which course to take yourself.
