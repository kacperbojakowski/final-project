## Degrees

### Are degrees necessary?

Degrees are not essential, but they are always a plus.  

Job offers often list degrees as "nice-to-have"; common majors include:  

* English Studies (or other language-related)
* Computer Science (or other IT- and technology-related)

*Technical Writing* or *Technical Communication* are also common in countries where such programs are taught at BA or MA level (not in Poland).  

As a translator, you likely studied translation, linguistics, or philology; this is a good start. A technical major would be even better.  

If you don't have a degree, ignore this part entirely; focus on [courses](../3-online-courses/) and [certificates](../4-certificates/index.md/#itcqf) instead.  

Taking a full-scale university course now would be overkill; you should be able to retrain within a year.  

### Technical communication at university

In Poland, you can now study [Technical Communication](https://www.vistula.edu.pl/kierunki-studiow/kontynuacja-edukacji/studia-podyplomowe/informatyka/komunikacja-techniczna) at Vistula University in Warsaw, as a part-time postgraduate course.  

The course lasts for two semesters (one academic year); the classes are held online on every other weekend, from 09:00 do 17:00, via MS Teams. The entry requirements are:

* A bachelor's diploma (or higher),
* Good working knowledge of English (B2 or higher)

Students are evaluated based on class participation and completion of assignments. The second semester ends with students defending their final projects.

The course was created in partnership with Atlassian, MadCap, ITCQF, and Techwriter.pl, among others. The class instructors are experienced tech comm experts.  

> ❗ **IMPORTANT:** Originally, the course took place on site, but went online in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program may change in the coming years; changes may include the course type, the curriculum, and other aspects of the offer.  

Some of the benefits are:

* Official training to prepare you for the [ITCQF](../4-certificates/index.md/#itcqf) exam.
* Licenses for professional paid software, such as:
  * Microsoft Office
  * Confluence
  * Jira
  * MadCap Flare
  * MemoQ.
* Insight from professionals active in the field; no "textbook knowledge"!
* Projects to help you practice the tools, polish your writing, and build your portfolio.
* Teamwork tasks to reflect real-life cases and technical writing workflow.
* Working with various technologies and tools:
  * Version control (Git, GitHub)
  * Code editors (VSC)
  * Static site generators (Jekyll, GitHub Pages),
  * Content and project management software (Confluence, Jira)
  * HAT software (MadCap Flare)
  * XML editors (OxygenXML)
  * HTML/CSS
  * DITA XML
  * Markdown
* Learning about the trends, standards, and practices:
  * Docs as Code,
  * Single sourcing and reuse,
  * Information architecture,
  * User experience,
  * Accessibility,
  * STE

and more!  

Definitely consider enrolling. Apart from a valuable point to add on your resume, you will get a chance to build a nice portfolio and – above all – to make friends with other technical writers.
