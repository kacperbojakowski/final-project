### Reviewing existing documentation

Begin your self-teaching with a resolution: next time you open the box of a newly-bought gadget or appliance, do what no sane person would do – *actually read the manual*.  

While reading, pay attention to these elements and aspects:

* Structure of the document at the "macro" level:
  * Table of contents
  * Division into sections and subsections (or chapters and subchapters)
  * Structural separation of different types of information, e.g., instructions (step-by-step procedures), concepts (descriptions, definitions), and reference information (datasheets, specifications)
  * Metatextual content (revision history, chapter objectives)
  * Legal notes (copyrights, regulations)
  * Glossaries, indexes, references
* Structure of sections and pages:
  * Page layout (headers and footers, margins, alignment, page numbers etc.)
  * Text style and formatting (font variants, headline styles, bullet lists, etc.).
* Localization (translations and regional adjustments, e.g., pictures featuring the correct, country-specific type of power plugs)
* Language style and grammar:
  * Language variety (e.g., British vs. American)
  * Grammatical correctness, punctuation, typos
  * Sentence structure (e.g., passive vs. active voice)
  * Choice of words (e.g., technical terms vs. plain language)
  * Ambiguity and redundancy (explicitness vs. cohesion)
  * Style and register
* Visual content (pictures and icons, including captions and indexing)
* Informational value (is it relevant and helpful?)

Assess the document by considering these questions:

* Are all necessary elements in place and properly structured?[^1]
* Is the information helpful, clear, and easy to find?
* Is the print sharp? Are images in high resolution? Is the text (well-) translated?
* Is the information correct, up-to-date, and conforming to industry standards (if applicable)?
* Can you access the content elsewhere (e.g., download as a PDF)?

> ❗ **IMPORTANT**: The above framework is *not* an industry-approved method for *documentation testing*; it's a simple outline to help you focus on aspects that may contribute to overall quality of documentation.

You could use the same approach for documents published online, but with some additional, web-specific points, such as:

* Website responsiveness: how well the website scales relative to window size on different devices?
* Are all elements loading and being displayed correctly?
* Are there fallbacks for fonts and alt-texts for images?
* Is the user interface intuitive and functional (e.g., collapsible navigation, "back to top" buttons, etc.)?
* Are links and anchor elements loading correctly and pointing to the right resources?

Once you spend some time reading documents and studying content design, you'll develop an eye for good (and bad) documentation, just like you did for translation. From then on, all you do is put theory to practice: mimic the good, avoid the bad, and follow approved trends in your writing.  

There might be moments when you think: *"OK, how do I know if this practice is good or bad?"*. Frankly, this confusion is what you are looking for. When it happens, google the thing or ask in the community. Whatever you learn this way, you will remember for long: problems itch most when they are personal.  

Sometimes you won't find a clear answer. Trends in tech comm are changing and there are always some conflicting views. You are a user, though, so you have a say in this too. I love navbars that collapse on scroll. My friend hates them. *What about you?*  

As for reading suggestions, any documentation should work, but if you're really pressed for time, you can kill two birds with one stone: 

* Read manuals for the products you buy.
* Read documentation (including tutorials) for the tools and technologies you learn (e.g., [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)).

Definitely check out professional docs on *how to write docs*: documentation style guides such as [Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/) or [Google developer style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).

### Blogs and podcasts

This is your best bet to stay updated in the field. Check out the blogs and podcasts below if you haven't already. They are maintained by professionals active in tech comm and related areas: expect lots of practical tips and real-life examples.

### Books

If you prefer a more traditional approach, there are books. Popular titles include:  

* *"Technical Communication"* by Mike Markel
* *"Technical Writing 101"* by Alan S. Pringle & Sarah S. O’Keefe
* *"Technical Writing for Dummies"* by Sheryl Lindsell-Robert
* *"The Insider’s Guide to Technical Writing"* by Krista Van Laan

> ❗ **IMPORTANT:** Due to rare updates of physical media, you shouldn't rely on them too much.  

### Writing

You can start with a short manual like [the one](../../02-overview/4-is-technical-writing-for-me/index.md/#try-before-you-buy) suggested earlier.

Once you get into gear, move on to longer projects. Try different [types of deliverables](../../04-learning-the-basics/1-types-of-deliverables/index.md) and writing something longer than one page. Always think about your *persona* – the target audience; adjust your language accordingly (maybe [STE](../../04-learning-the-basics/3-content-design/#ste-and-plain-english) this time?).  

Write using different tools. Consider starting with this setup:

* Writing with Markdown in Visual Studio Code
* Publishing on [GitHub Pages](../../07-employment/1-portfolio/index.md/#publishing-on-github-pages)

Regularly come back to your earlier documents and try to correct them based on what you have learned since. If you have a chance, ask someone for a peer review; if not from tech comm, then your fellow translator.

Finally, don't be a lone wolf all the time. Join the community so you can contribute and have your work evaluated. Studying together is fun, and it opens opportunities.
