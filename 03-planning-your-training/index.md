# Planning your training

This section will help you plan your retraining in the context of your current profession. As a translator, you already have solid foundations to build on, with a few transferable skills under your belt. Your experience can give you a head start at the beginning, but it can also be an asset later in your career. In the topics, you will learn what skills you can tick off, what you still need to work on, and what new challenges await you in technical writing.
