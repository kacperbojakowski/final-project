## Types of deliverables

### Product documentation

**User guides** are probably what most people think of when they hear about written instructions. Those can include various manuals: quick-start guides, installation guides, how-to guides, and the like. User guides are usually what you find when you're unboxing newly bought gadgets or appliances. They may have a book-like structure and consist of many chapters (e.g., operation instructions, maintenance and cleaning guide, etc.) or they can be a single leaflet with pictures rather than words. They can be in PDF apart from ‚Äì or instead of ‚Äì the printed format. User guides can be targeted at regular end users, or they can describe low-level procedures for specialists (e.g. implementation guides for engineers).

**Online help** is what you likely use when you get lost in your operating system or other software; think of a question mark icon in an interface of an app, or a window that pops up when you press `F1`. Online help is embedded into the software, so that you can refer to it while using a program, and only when you need it to solve a specific problem; it is not designed to be read as a whole.  

**Mobile application help** is very similar to online help, only that it refers to apps on mobile devices. For this type of documentation, the design is very important. Mobile help should be adapted to the limited viewing space on a smartphone (or tablet, etc.), and scale well across devices.  

**Knowledge Bases** are those big, website-like support portals; they're essentially online platforms with many articles, how-to-guides, reference information, FAQ and download sections, and so on. For an example, check out the [Dropbox Help Center](https://help.dropbox.com/).  

**Release notes** is what you have pop up in an app whenever there's an update. They are brief notes that inform you about changes in new versions of software, such as new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. You may find them on a website for a program you are using, under "version history" (or something similar).  

**API documentation** are documents for software developers working with an application programming interface (API). It helps programmers to make two (or more) apps (or services, systems, and so on) work together. For example, when you're writing an Android app and you want your users to be able to log in it through their Facebook account, you'd need the Facebook API to know how to implement this. API documentation describes [endpoints](../../09-glossary/index.md/#e), lists possible parameters, return values, etc.; it may also involve tutorials on how to perform some low-level procedures.  

### Training materials

**Presentations** are best known in the form of PowerPoint slides or animated Prezi templates, though there are more tools like that. Presentations are used during lectures, training sessions, product demos, etc. They are usually heavy on visuals: both images and videos; this is but one of many reasons why technical writers need design skills.  

**Classroom trainings** involve a broader scope of materials, including both physical and digital content: presentations, textbooks, handouts, exercises, quizzes, and certificates. This type of materials may aid students as well as class instructors.  

**E-learning** courses usually take place on special online platforms. The materials should be so designed as to require minimum to no supervision from a class instructor. E-learning courses are usually self-paced and divided into consecutive sections, to which students advance only after they cover a portion of material and complete a quiz.  

**Webinars** are prepared in cases when physical class attendance is impossible, inconvenient, or not desired. They combine the benefits of e-learning with bidirectional communication between students and instructors, similarly to classroom trainings. They are held in the form of a video conference with a chat functionality whereby students can ask questions in real time.  

### Process documentation

**Project documentation** is necessary to begin a well-organized project. It is created at the earliest stage of project work and later used as an input for the subsequent planning phase. The documents include project proposals, requirements specifications, and so on.  

**Policies and procedures** are documents created within an organization to describe ‚Äì and prescribe ‚Äì its inner functioning: with rules, guidelines, processes, etc. They standardize procedures and list best practices. As a result, they increase transparency and allow for more efficient management.  

**Reports** are documents that involve an analysis of a given topic, together with results and conclusions. The structure and length will vary depending on the data set and the target audience. The latter can be anyone who needs some analytical overview for referrenece: managers, quality assurance specialists, or business partners, among others.  

> üñäÔ∏è **NOTE:** This description was prepared based on the classification provided by the [ITCQF training syllabus](https://itcqf.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ITCQF_Syllabus_v2_0Jun2020.pdf). In your career, you might encounter different naming conventions or cases when certain document types overlap.
