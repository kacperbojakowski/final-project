# Conclusion

Congratulations! If you're really reading this as a conclusion (i.e., you've covered all the topics before), then you have shown some resilience! That's great: you might need it to power through even wordier docs in the future.  

I hope you enjoyed it and found it useful. If not – that's fine too! We read good documentation to learn how to write, but learning how *not to write* is no less important. You can find opportunities for growth in anything if you search deeply enough (*just don't nag your SME too much!*).

Before you go, check out the step-by-step summary below. It's a sample plan for you to modify or follow as is. Remember: you don't have to wait till you've ticked all the steps off. Look out for job offers as you go, and you might succeed earlier than planned. Don't fall into the trap of never being *ready enough* – but don't come unprepared either. Try to find some middle ground. Think positive and treat every interview as a valuable lesson, regardless of how it goes. It's part of the training.  

From here, the floor is yours. Read on, practice, and chase opportunities. Good luck!
