###### J

**Jekyll** – a very popular [static site generator](#s). |  

###### K 

###### L

**Low-level operation** – any operation that concerns more specific elements of a system; requires deeper technical knowledge than [high-level operations](#h). |  

###### M

**Markdown** – a [markup language](#m) with simple tags that allow for quick and easy formatting of text; used especially in web writing; converts to HTML. |  

**Markup language** – a computer language with tags that can be interpreted by software as instructions to format or otherwise transform the encoded text. |  

###### N 

###### O

**Open-source software** – software which anybody can modify and contribute to; a source code that is open to and maintained by the public. |  

**Output** – the end-result achieved through the processing of [input](#i). |  

###### P

**Persona** – in content design, a fictional profile with features that represent some key characteristics (e.g., level of knowledge, social group, age) of the target audience. |  

**Plain English** – a subset of English that is easy to understand, with simple vocabulary and grammar. |  

###### Q 

###### R

**Raster graphics** – a type of computer graphics where the image is represented as a grid of pixels; example: JPG. | *See also: [Vector graphics](#v)*  

**Relative path** – a path that leads to a file or a folder and uses the current location as a starting point, e.g., `../images/avatar.jpg`. | *See also: [Absolute path](#a)*  

**Reuse** – a practice where a piece of content is written once and then reused many times, e.g., as snippets. |  

###### S

**Vector graphics** – a type of computer graphics where the image is drawn by a computer along specified coordinates, according to a set of commands and mathematical statements.
