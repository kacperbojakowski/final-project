# How to Get into Technical Writing: A Guide for Translators

## Introduction

Welcome to the guide on how to retrain from translation to technical writing. Changing careers can be daunting, but don't let fear hold you back! Translators make great documentation writers, and you certainly won't be the first to take this path. As a language professional, you already have skills that should give you a solid head start. All you need is some technical background and basic understanding of the field. In this guide, you will learn about:

* Career opportunities in technical communication
* Basic concepts and knowledge required in the field
* Tools used by tech comm specialists in everyday work
* Courses and certifications for technical writers

You will also learn how to build your portfolio, how to prepare your resume, and ‚Äì hopefully ‚Äì how to land your first job as a technical writer.

### How to use this guide

The guide is divided into *sections*: larger chunks of content, and *topics*: smaller and more specific subchapters. You can access every section and topic at any time from the navigation bar or from the [table of contents](#table-of-contents) further down on this page.  

The [Overview](02-overview/index.md) briefly describes what technical communication is and what to expect as a beginner in the field. [Planning](03-planning-your-training/index.md) will help you strategize your training according to your current knowledge and experience. [Basics](04-learning-the-basics/index.md) cover a few fundamental concepts you should be familiar with for an easier start. For a more practical perspective, refer to [Tools](05-tools/index.md), where you will learn about the software. [Education](06-education/index.md) should help you decide which courses and certificates are worth your time. Finally, in the [Employment](07-employment/index.md) section, you will learn how to showcase your skills and prepare for an interview.  

Refer to the [Glossary](09-glossary/index.md) if technical jargon confuses you. In the [Links](10-links/index.md) section, you will find all the websites and resources hyperlinked throughout this guide.

You can go through the pages in order by clicking "Next section/topic" at the bottom, or you can jump straight to whatever interests you and skip the rest. Works either way!
